== Bennies
We use a deck of Tokens for these. 
This deck may vary depending on the genre of the game.

To access your stack of bennies, click the benny token above your name at the bottom of the screen (in a semi-transparent box). 
// <!-- If you have multiple decks in your hand (e.g., bennies *and* adventure cards), click the By Deck filter button at the top right hand corner to sort decks. -->
To spend a benny, click the token and drag it to the tabletop. 
If you spend a benny by mistake, right-click it and select **Take Card** to put it back in your hand.
To close the view of your bennies, click the benny token above your name at the bottom of the screen.

== Initiative
We deal cards for the turn order. 
If you have an edge of other modifier that effects cards, make sure it is known to the GM. 
If the GM forgets, remind him.

== Status and conditions

The following token overlays are used to indicate status/conditions in combat. 
Of course, other tokens may also be used as needed.
