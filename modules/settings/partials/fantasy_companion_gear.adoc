== Armor
////
Armor is written in parentheses next to a character’s Toughness, like this: 11 (2). 
This means 2 points of the character’s 11 Toughness comes from Armor. 
An Armor Piercing attack can bypass those 2 points but not the other 9.
Note that greaves (leg guards) and vambraces (arm guards) are listed as pairs. 
Halve the weight and cost if a character wears only half the set (Minimum Strength doesn’t change).
