== Black Powder Weapons

Black powder weapons are only available in settings where gunpowder exists and is commonly available. 
They are all Reload 2, so many black powder users preload several flintlocks and simply drop them after firing.

[[bandolier]]
Bandolier:: 
An ammunition belt that hangs from the shoulder diagonally across the body to the waist.
A bandolier holds 12 _apostles_. 
Apostle::: 
A wooden tube that contains a measured amount of black powder. 
To load, one bites bites or tears off the end, and pours the contents into the firearm barrel.
[[lead_shot]]
Lead shot:: 
Black powder weapons fire balls of different weights and sizes. 
Assume all black powder firearms use the same size balls.
Match:: 
A length of treated cord designed to burn slowly. 
A single length is good for creating 10 matches for a matchlock firearm.
[[mskt_stand]]
Musket Stand:: Muskets are long, cumbersome weapons, best fired when resting on something. 
A musket stand is a sturdy rod with an inverted U-shaped end in which a musket can be rested. 
When using a stand, the Minimum Strength rating of a musket is reduced by two die types. 
It also increases the range by an additional 2/4/8 because the weapon is more stable.
[[pwdr_hrn]]
Powder Flash or Horn:: 
Ranging from crude hollowed-out horns with caps to gilded brass flasks decorated in relief.

== Explosives

Explosives are simple devices. 
To create an explosion, one nserts a fuse in a cask or barrel of blackpowder, lights the fuse, and then runs. 
Defusing an explosive device requires only the fuse to be pulled out or extinguished, such as with water or stamping on it.

Grenade:: Grenades are iron-spheres packed with a small amount of explosives and ignited by a slow-burning fuse. 
A typical fuse burns down in one round, but this can be extended to virtually any length of time by inserting a long fuse. 
Lighting the fuse takes an action; throwing the grenade is a separate action.
