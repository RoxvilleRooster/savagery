Pirating RPG content is not cool. 
Most folks making tabletop RPG products struggle to make a buck. 
Buy tabletop RPG books from your Friendly Local Area Gaming Store or from online vendors like xref:https://www.drivethrurpg.com/[DriveThruRPG].

// tag::rule-stunts[]
A stunt action is any action that is performed in a flashier than normal way.
Any hero who attempts a stunt action deserves a benny.

In game terms, a stunt is an action where the player purposefully makes the action more difficult for the hero.
A stunt action always requires a trait roll, at a minimum -2 penalty.
The GM is the final arbiter of the roll penalty of a particular stunt action.

Conventional action::
Getting on board a helicopter before it takes off from the platform is an action

Stunt action::
Leaping from a moving vehicle to grab on to the helicopter as the helo is taking off.

// tag::rule-surrender[]
When the heroes surrender at a dramatically fitting place in the story and go along with the demands of the antagonists, each player takes a benny.
The GM may need to signal that we're using the "surrender" rule at this point.
