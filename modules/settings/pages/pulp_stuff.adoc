Up close, the blast can be devastating.

=== Machine guns

Machine guns are heavy, fully automatic weapons built to withstand prolonged fire. Most are fed by belts
or drums and thus have far more ammo capacity than assault rifles, despite similar calibers and rates of fire.

Weapon Mount:: Most machine-guns require a bipod, tripod, or vehicle mount to fire, which eliminates any
Strength requirement and the Recoil penalty (see SWADE p 105). Their Minimum Strength is listed as “NA,” or
“Not Applicable.” If a weapon has a Minimum Strength listed, it may be fired from the hip with the Snapfire
and Recoil penalties.

Minimum Rate of Fire:: Machine-guns have a minimum Rate of Fire of 2 unless otherwise noted.

Reloading:: Machine guns are Reload 2, which includes changing belts or drums, cocking, etc.

== Grenades

Grenades activate when their safety pin is pulled, then detonate a few seconds later.
They are thrown with the Athletics skill at the Ranges listed below, and cannot make use of Extreme Range (see SWADE p 93).

All grenades are Heavy Weapons and detonate in the listed blast template (see Area Effect Attacks, SWADE p 97).

Grenades may be Evaded (see "Evasion", SWADE p 100).

== Vehicular Weapons
All except the medium machine gun are Heavy Weapons.
Minimum Rate of Fire: Vehicular weapons with a Rate of Fire 3 or higher have a minimum Rate of Fire of 2.

Heavy Flamethrowers: Vehicular flamethrowers have longer ranges than personal devices.
The wielder can use the Cone Template or arc a blast the size of a Medium Blast Template up to 18” (36 yards) distant. 
(Use the center of the template for the Range.) 
This shot can Deviate (see Area Effect Attacks,page 97).

Tank and AT Guns: May fire either Armor Piercing (AP) or High-Explosive (HE) rounds as the gunner chooses.
AP rounds do additional damage up close. 
Increase the weapon’s damage dice by one when fired at half their Short Range or less (so 4d10+2 becomes 5d10+2, for example).
// Costs: Prices of military-grade weapons varies widely depending on setting, and should be considered baselines the GM can use to set prices in her campaign world.
