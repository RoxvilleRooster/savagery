// _These setting rules are are largely a subset of the rules from Reality Blurs' "Agents of Oblivion"._

In its time in the early 1980s, Merle M. Rasmussen's original https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Secret_(role-playing_game)[_Top Secret_,window=_blank] game was great in so many ways.
Let's keep playing in the world of Top Secret using Savage Worlds for the rule system.

My "Savaged Top Secret" home game setting leverages Thomas Clegg's _Tuxedos and Trenchcoats: A Spy Thriller Setting For Savage Worlds_ and Allan Wroe's _The Secret Files of Section D: Espionage Roleplaying In A World on the Brink of War_ (Imaginarium Games, 2022).

[NOTE]
====
The rules and text here are a work-in-progress effort.

* I'll add a gear list
* I want to keep the setting rules lean and not add much more (but _{sfsd}_ has so many good ones!)
