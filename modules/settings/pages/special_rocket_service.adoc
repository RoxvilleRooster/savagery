= Special Rocket Service

[sidebar]
This is an adaptation of the "Rocket Rangers" supplement for the _Daring Tales of Adventure_ series for Savage Worlds (Triple Ace Games). 

The heroes are members of the Special Rocket Service (SRS), a new organization that uses advanced rocket technology to get into places where others cannot. 
They are equipped with rocket packs, allowing them to fly and perform incredible feats of agility and speed.

Each member of the SRS is a specialist in their own right, and they work together to complete missions that require their unique skills.

Unlike the counterpart, the Rocket Nazis, the SRS is a force for good, using their advanced technology to protect and serve.

The SRS is formed as a search and rescue team, often sent into dangerous situations to retrieve lost or captured agents, or to recover valuable technology.

The founder of the SRS, Doctor Xenophon Chocolate, is a brilliant scientist who has developed the rocket technology that powers the team's equipment.
Chocolate is a quaker and a pacifist, but he understands the need for the SRS to be able to defend themselves and others when necessary.
The team is trained in non-violent conflict resolution, but they are also prepared to use force if the situation demands it.

The SRS operates under the authority of the British government, and they are often called upon to assist in international crises or to deal with threats that require their unique capabilities.

Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook, is the political figure who backs the SRS.

Jimmy Floyd is Doc Chocolate's assistant, mechanic, and engineer.
