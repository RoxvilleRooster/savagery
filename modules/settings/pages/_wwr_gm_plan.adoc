== Events

=== Monster in the bath

Inspired by Andi Newton's "Green Water", where a Celtic woman avenges the murder of druids by becoming the monster in the Roman bath at Aquae Sulis.


=== Hounds of death

Inspired by William Meikle's "The Hounds of the Dawn", this tale focuses on curse from a Briton against the Romans who killed her people and dishonored her husband.

____
She raised her hands and began a chant, grotesque malformed words none present but her showed any sign of understanding, coarse, guttural sounds that hung and echoed in the quiet air long after she herself had fallen quiet under the whips and scourges of her guards and was dragged away.
____

The "hounds" form from a dark mist and, night by night, shred the officer's men and staff.

Can the heroes stop this?

=== Bloodsport

Inspired by Josh Reynolds' "Matched Pairs", focuses on a Briton and a set of gladiators and  criminals set to fight in a aristocrat's personal gladiatorial games.
The aristocrat has a otherworldly monster that he sets on the gladiators:

____
It was like nothing Attilus had ever seen - a gargantuan, toad-like shape, elephantine in size, its insectile proboscis surrounded by a forest of writhing tendrils. He thought he glimpsed stubby wings on its back, and its claws were those of some great crustacean. It uttered a painful, whistling shriek as it bounded towards them with frog-like leaps. The ground shook beneath its tread as it approached.
____


=== Down in the pit

Inspired by Glynn Owen Barrass' "The Ruins at Raven's Rock", focuses on unit of legionaries sent to investigate an old "holy" site but instead awaken an ancient cosmic power.


=== Sickness

Inspired by John Linwood Grant's "Mothers Of Flesh And Fire", this story focuses on legionaries who brought back a supernatural sickness to the Roman civilization in Eboracum, that was tied to an ancient ane corrupt fertility goddess.

=== Elevator Pitch 
Commodus, a dissolute emperor rules from Rome and claims the name Britannicus.
The years of the five good emperors now seem a distant memory. 
The army has grown undisciplined and mutinous.
North of Hadrian's wall, the tribal peoples stir; to the south, years of rule and subjugation cast a long shadow.
In these shadows, dark beings rise up. 
In the twilight of a fading empire, the heroes do what they must.    

You are a soldier in an auxiliary cavalry cohort stationed near Hadrian's wall at the close of the 2nd century AD. 
You and your fellows are members of the same file (10-man unit within a turma).
