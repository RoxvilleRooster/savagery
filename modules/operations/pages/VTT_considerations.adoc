== Short VTT sessions and benny refresh
Our VTT sessions typically last 2 to 2.5 hours whereas a conventional physical tabletop session tends to run 4 to 5 hours (SWADE p 194).
In this campaign, it takes 2 VTT sessions to equal 1 _game session_ in SWADE. As a result, bennies refresh on VTT sessions with odd numbers.

For example:

* VTT session 1 - start with full bennies
* VTT session 2 - bennies do not refresh (as if it were the second half of a physical tabletop session)
* VTT session 3 - bennies are refreshed at session start
* VTT session 4 - bennies do not refresh (as if it were the second half of a physical tabletop session)
* VTT session 5 - bennies are refreshed at session start
* and so on

In addition to benny refresh-related rules, edges, and hindrances, this change to the SWADE rules also affects:

* the Connections edge (usable once per SWADE session, SWADE p50)
* chronic diseases (SWADE p 126)

== Experience points and advances
At the end of each VTT session, the GM typically awards 2 experience points (XP) (and, on occasion, 3 XP). An advance is earned every 5 XP increment. If you miss a session, your hero does not receive an XP award.
