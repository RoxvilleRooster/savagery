== Setting rules

The settings rules assume that the players play the crew like that of the _Serenity_.

All heroes have the Poverty hindrance. The crew's financial situation is almost always tight and near broke. Income is uncertain.

The following setting rules from SWADE are fitting for a Savage Worlds Firefly campaign:

* Conviction (SWADE 136)

==== Hindrance trappings

Suggested re-skins of existing hindrances include:

* Trap the Outsider (Minor) hindrance as "Browncoat"
* Trap the Clueless (Major) hindrance as "Greenhorn"
* Trap the Obligation (Minor or Major) hindrance as "Debt" or "In Debt to..."


=== Favors, Contacts, and Perks

==== Favors
[[favors]]

These rules are from Eric Lamoureux and _Just Insert Imagination_'s _Wiseguys_ but they should work really well for the Firefly setting. Buy _Wiseguys_ on https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/290098/Wiseguys-The-Savage-Guide-to-Organized-Crime[ DTRPG,role=external,window=_blank].

When spending a Benny to Influence the Story, a player can do things like make up a new acquaintance to gain a clue, information, gear, or access to a restricted area. In this instance, the hero recalls that an old friend still owes a favor. This assumes that the acquaintance has a Friendly attitude and is available to help.

Only allow the player group to use the _Influence the Story_ rule for a Favor once per session.

After the acquaintance does the favor, he fades into the background unless a player spends a Benny to add the character to his list of _Contacts_. Now that this contact has performed the favor, the contact's Reaction to the hero returns to Neutral.

==== Contacts

Contacts are different from the Connections edge. A contact provides personal and specialized assistance.

You can draw a card from a deck and then the GM can refer to chapter six in  _Wiseguys_ to generate a contact for the game.
Talk to your GM about creating a contact.

You can provide a hero a contact in the following ways:

//* By taking A Friend of Mine as an Edge
* By spending a Benny to convert a character who performed a Favor for the hero into a Contact (see <<favors,Favors>>).
* By spending a Benny to turn a character that the hero met through the Connections edge into a Contact.
* By meeting people during the campaign, based on the GM's discretion and roleplay.
* As a reward for completing an assignment.
// * For finding certain Artifacts (see Chapter Seven)

Contacts are Wild Cards, even if they really came into the story as Extras. A player is allowed to call on one Contact per session. Contacts do not wait around and may not always be available when called on. Reciprocity is important; a contact expects the hero to return a favor when called. A loyal contact can turn if the hero mistreats him; heroes need to nurture and maintain relationships with contacts.

A hero uses the Reactions table to represent the status of the relationship between a the hero and his Contact. The initial attitude of the contact depends on how the relationship starts; it is typically Neutral.

===== Maintaining the relationships with a Contact

If the attitude of a Contact falls to Hostile, the contact becomes a foe to the hero and the hero gains the Enemy (Minor) Hindrance.

The hero can also develop the relationship with the contact and improve the attitude of the Contact’s to Helpful. In this case, the hero gets access to a “Perk” from the Contact.

At the session's start, the GM can ask each player who's hero has a Contact to draw a card from the Action Deck. If the player draws a face card, check the Contact Event Table (https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/290098/Wiseguys-The-Savage-Guide-to-Organized-Crime[ Wiseguys,role=external,window=_blank], 33).

==== Perks

A Perk is a service, favor, or item that a Contact offers a hero that goes beyond what a Contact generally provides a hero.

Beware, a perk can come with strings attached.

=== Heists

Firefly is all about the crew attempting to pull heists.

.Where these rules come from
****
These rules are derived from Eric Lamoureux and _Just Insert Imagination_'s _Wiseguys_, with some minor adjustments that suit the flavor of the Firefly setting. Buy _Wiseguys_ on https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/290098/Wiseguys-The-Savage-Guide-to-Organized-Crime[ DTRPG,role=external,window=_blank].
****

Use Dramatic Tasks for running heist scenes with the option Multiple Skills.
For each step in the heist use a different skill and have a different character perform that skill until all the key characters have their turn.

You can use a Quick Encounter for a heist that is either (a) a minor part of a scenario or (b) when game time is short. Each person engaged in the heist chooses a different skill. A heist is a group  effort; whether it succeeds depends on the members of the team.

==== Planning the heist

Consider using a _preparation montage_. Drop the characters into the heist and then use these mechanics and allow the players to describe the heist's preparations.

Have each player pick an appropriate skill and the group keeps the highest roll. For every success and raise, award the crew a Heist Token.

Suggested skills for preparation montages:

* Academics
* Common Knowledge
* Electronics
* Hacking
* Intimidation
* Persuasion
* Repair
* Research
* Science

==== Running the heist scene

Start the heist's Dramatic Task or Quick Encounter. During the heist, the players can redeem Heist Tokens to _Influence the Story_ as per "Using Bennies in Savage Worlds".

A player can spend a Benny to influence the narrative, making a story, which allows the player character to

[loweralpha]
a. use a different skill for a step of the Dramatic Task than the GM determined or
a. call upon help from a Contact or Connections to bypass the challenge.


You can use a flashback to show what happened to influence the story and facilitate the success of the heist.

Examples of influencing the story include:

* bribing a guard
* placing an object that creates a diversion or distraction
* replacing one object (e.g., a forgery) for another
* bypassing a security system
* finding objects (e.g., uniforms, badges) or covers to blend in

==== Generating a heist

Heists are a fixture of a Firefly campaign.

.Where these rules come from
****
See the "Heist Generator" rules (https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/290098/Wiseguys-The-Savage-Guide-to-Organized-Crime[ Wiseguys,role=external,window=_blank], 36). Minor tweaks to the original rules are intended to reflect the Firefly setting.
****

For each scene of a heist's dramatic task or quick encounter, the GM can draw a card for inspiration.

[[Complications]]
===== Complications

If you draw a club, compare the card value against the table below.

[cols="^1,^2,5",options="header"]
|===================================================
| Card | Nature | Comments

| 3 | Recent change | A password, lock, or  combination was altered. What now?
| 4 | Surveillance | The crew's activities has been noticed and monitored.
| 5 | Unforeseen bystanders | These people were not supposed to be in the location at this time!
| 6 | Rival crew | There's another crew pulling the same caper or watching the crew pull it off.
| 7 | Unforeseen security | The guards were not supposed to be on duty at this location at this time. For some reason, the guard rotation changed.

| 10 | Alarm systems upgraded | These systems are more advanced than your intel revealed.

| Ace | Bogies | Military, lawmen, or gangsters are active in the location for some reason at this time.

===== Guards

Examples of guards include:

* guard dogs
* robotic sentries or drones
* private security
* protective staff (managers and supervisors, receptionists)
* interested third parties (journalists)


Examples of skills used to bypass guards include:

* *Shooting* to take out a guard (lethal) or deliver a knockout drug/poison
* *Survival* to distract or lure away a guard animal
* *Athletics* to lob a knockout grenade in the right spot to incapacitate the guards
* *Healing* to cook up a treat that will disable or distract the guards
* *Common Knowledge* or *Research* to know the timing and details of guard shift changes
* *Stealth* to sneak up on a guard and administer a sedative or a chloroform-like substance

===== Subterfuge

You need to get around or avoid security measures.

Examples of skills for subterfuge elements of the heist include:

* Persuasion (fast talking)
* Stealth
* Athletics
* Electronics
* Hacking
* Repair
